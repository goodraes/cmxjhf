　　村里人并不是认为居住的地方不美。恰恰相反，他们认为美得很哩，但那美是在于给他们的生存提供了种种优越，而并非其它。　　春天的时候，我在村子的麦田里照了一卷胶卷。那碧波荡漾的麦子，笑着生活的灿烂。村里人都不解，为什么大老远地跑到麦田里站一站，嗅一嗅?我觉得自己无法解释。　　还有许多的许多东西。　　河流、花草、树木、庄稼。　　村里人都觉得它们很平常。　　村里人是不会把大自然当作风景的，他们和自然已经融为一体。他们把它当头、当手、当脚，每天都亲切过的，一点也不激动。也可以反过来把自己当作大自然的一棵树，一根竹子……一棵庄稼，炎热的时候，他们能躺在凉地上睡得你难辨真假。　　村里人眼中的风景是些人性化的东西。　　比如热闹。哪个地方吵闹，哪个地方死了人，哪个地方唱戏，他们会老远地跑去，那是并不多见的，见了还要反复地回忆、咏叹。　　比如一些更文明的东西。许多城里人，他们到乡下去游玩，不知不觉地也带去了一些风景。照相机的闪光灯一闪，桑塔纳的“嘟嘟”一叫，都会让一个打瞌睡的老头突然精神亢奋。　　这样，如果光选风景是比较美好的地方，那还太空洞了些。风景是人们眼中少见、心里缺乏的东西。
　　是的，惠州对我来说，确有太多值得回忆的往事了。这座美丽的城市与我三次离合，每一次离合之后，我对她的亲近之情自然又浓郁了许多。

The villagers are not think living place is not beautiful.
On the contrary, they think that very beautiful, but the beauty is to their survival provides a variety of superior, not the other.
In the spring, I in the village of wheat fields as a roll of film.
The rippling wheat, the bright life with a smile.
The villagers all don't understand, why run to catcher in a stand in the distance, smell a smell?
I think I can't explain.
There are many many things.
Rivers, flowers, trees and the crops.
The villagers all think they are very common.
The villagers are not as nature of the scenery, and natural they have now.
They put it head, hands and feet, kind of every day, was not a bit excited.
Can, in turn, think of themselves as the nature of a tree, a piece of bamboo...
A tree crops, hot, they will be able to sleep lying on the cold ground you failure to true and false.
The villagers in the eyes of the scenery is something personal.
Such as busy.
Where noise, where dead people, act in an opera in which place, they are going to run far away, that is does not see more, see also repeatedly memories, sichuan.
Such as some of the more civilized.
Many city dwellers, who play a trip to the country to unconsciously also brought some scenery.
The flash of the camera flash, santana, "doodle" a call, can make a nap of the old man suddenly high spirits.
So, if light selected scenery is a good place, it is too empty.
The scenery is rare in people look, the in the mind of things.
Yes, huizhou, for me, there are too many memorable things of the past.
This beautiful city and I clutch three times, each time the clutch, after I told her the feeling of close to nature and a lot of strong.
